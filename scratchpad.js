If you live or work in New York City, and often take the same subway, you may not find it worth
the effort to open a traditional mapping application, select your destination and retrieve point to point
directions.   

Since we all use one of the closest subways, the app is intended to give New Yorkers the exact information
they need simply by openning the app. If you are in NYC, 
it will open to your current location and display all of the subway stations
within one mile.  The first three stations appear on the upper portion of the screen, and you can scroll
down to see rest of the stops.  

The lower section of the screen shows the expected arrival of the next
four northbound trains.  By swiping left, you will see the list of southbound trains, and another left swipe
will show then station in relation to lour location on a map.

Nearby Subways will udate the list of nearest trains every 50 meters while it is open. While viewing a specific
station, the expected arrivals will update every 15 seconds.

If you are planning a trip to  NYC, the app can still be used to find the nearest subway stations to
any location in NYC. Tap the icon in the upper right corner, and enter the name of a place (Madison Square Garden),
or an address, select it from the menu and it will display the same information. 

Typical uses:
- Economize your time by leaving your home or office just in time to catch the next train.
